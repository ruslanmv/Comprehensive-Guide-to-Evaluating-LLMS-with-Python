### Metrics and Implementations

#### 1. **Hallucination Reduction Rate (HRR)**

**Formula**:
\[
HRR = \frac{\text{Number of hallucinations reduced}}{\text{Total hallucinations in baseline}} \times 100
\]

**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_hrr(baseline_outputs, validated_outputs):
    hallucinations_reduced = sum(
        1 for base, valid in zip(baseline_outputs, validated_outputs)
        if base.get("is_hallucination") and not valid.get("is_hallucination")
    )
    total_hallucinations = sum(1 for base in baseline_outputs if base.get("is_hallucination"))
    return (hallucinations_reduced / total_hallucinations) * 100 if total_hallucinations > 0 else 0
```

**Example**:
```python
baseline_outputs = [
    {"query": "What is the boiling point of water?", "output": "50°C", "is_hallucination": True},
    {"query": "Who wrote Hamlet?", "output": "Charles Dickens", "is_hallucination": True}
]
validated_outputs = [
    {"query": "What is the boiling point of water?", "output": "100°C", "is_hallucination": False},
    {"query": "Who wrote Hamlet?", "output": "William Shakespeare", "is_hallucination": False}
]
hrr_score = calculate_hrr(baseline_outputs, validated_outputs)
print(f"Hallucination Reduction Rate (HRR): {hrr_score:.2f}%")
```

**Result**:
```
Hallucination Reduction Rate (HRR): 100.00%
```

**Explanation**:
- HRR indicates the percentage of factual hallucinations corrected. A high HRR (e.g., 100%) means the model successfully eliminated hallucinations.

---

#### 2. **Logical Consistency Score (LCS)**

**Formula**:
\[
LCS = \frac{\text{Number of logically consistent responses}}{\text{Total responses}} \times 100
\]

**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_lcs(responses):
    consistent_responses = sum(1 for response in responses if response.get("is_consistent"))
    return (consistent_responses / len(responses)) * 100
```

**Example**:
```python
responses = [
    {"query": "If A > B and B > C, is A > C?", "output": "Yes", "is_consistent": True},
    {"query": "Can a square have three sides?", "output": "No", "is_consistent": True}
]
lcs_score = calculate_lcs(responses)
print(f"Logical Consistency Score (LCS): {lcs_score:.2f}%")
```

**Result**:
```
Logical Consistency Score (LCS): 100.00%
```

**Explanation**:
- Logical consistency ensures reasoning accuracy. A high LCS reflects that the model adheres to logical reasoning principles.

---

#### 3. **Response Accuracy (RA)**

**Formula**:
\[
RA = \frac{\text{Number of correct responses}}{\text{Total queries}} \times 100
\]

**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_ra(gold_standard, model_outputs):
    correct_responses = sum(
        1 for gold, output in zip(gold_standard, model_outputs)
        if gold["correct_answer"] == output["output"]
    )
    return (correct_responses / len(gold_standard)) * 100
```

**Example**:
```python
ra_score = calculate_ra(gold_standard, model_outputs)
print(f"Response Accuracy (RA): {ra_score:.2f}%")
```

**Result**:
```
Response Accuracy (RA): 66.67%
```

**Explanation**:
- RA evaluates factual correctness. A low score indicates the need for improvement in providing accurate answers.

---

#### 4. **Exact Match (EM)**

**Implementation**:
```python
def exact_match(prediction, target):
    return prediction == target
```

**Example**:
```python
em_score = exact_match("Paris", "Paris")
print(f"Exact Match (EM): {em_score}")
```

**Result**:
```
Exact Match (EM): True
```

**Explanation**:
- EM checks for a perfect match between prediction and reference. Useful in structured tasks.

---

#### 5. **F1 Score**

**Formula**:
\[
F1 = \frac{2 \times (\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall})}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\]

**Implementation**:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

def calculate_f1(predictions, targets):
    return f1_score(targets, predictions)
```

**Example**:
```python
predictions = [1, 0, 1, 1]
targets = [1, 0, 0, 1]
print(f"F1 Score: {calculate_f1(predictions, targets):.2f}")
```

**Result**:
```
F1 Score: 0.80
```

**Explanation**:
- Balances precision and recall. A score close to 1 indicates high reliability.

---

#### 6. **ROUGE**

**Implementation**:
```python
from rouge_score import rouge_scorer

def calculate_rouge(prediction, target):
    scorer = rouge_scorer.RougeScorer(['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_stemmer=True)
    return scorer.score(target, prediction)
```

**Example**:
```python
rouge_scores = calculate_rouge("The cat sat on the mat.", "The cat is on the mat.")
print(rouge_scores)
```

**Result**:
```
ROUGE Scores: {'rouge1': ..., 'rougeL': ...}
```

**Explanation**:
- Measures textual overlap. Useful in summarization tasks.

---

#### 7. **BLEU**

**Implementation**:
```python
from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu

def calculate_bleu(prediction, target):
    reference = [target.split()]
    candidate = prediction.split()
    smoothing_function = SmoothingFunction().method1
    return sentence_bleu(reference, candidate, smoothing_function=smoothing_function)
```

**Example**:
```python
bleu_score = calculate_bleu("The cat is on the mat.", "The cat sat on the mat.")
print(f"BLEU Score: {bleu_score:.2f}")
```

**Result**:
```
BLEU Score: 0.25
```

**Explanation**:
- BLEU evaluates translation quality. Lower scores indicate fewer matches.

---

#### 8. **Toxicity Detection**

**Implementation**:
```python
from detoxify import Detoxify

def detect_toxicity(text):
    model = Detoxify('original')
    return model.predict(text)
```

**Example**:
```python
for text in texts:
    print(f"Toxicity for '{text}': {detect_toxicity(text)}")
```

**Result**:
```
Toxicity for 'This is a respectful comment.': ...
```

**Explanation**:
- Scores close to zero suggest safer outputs.

 9. **Perplexity with lm-evaluation-harness**
Perplexity is a metric used to evaluate how well a language model predicts a sample of text. It measures the uncertainty of the model when generating the next token in a sequence. Lower perplexity values indicate that the model is more confident and fluent in its predictions.
Low perplexity reflects high fluency and confidence in generated text.
```python
from lm_eval.evaluator import simple_evaluate

results = simple_evaluate(
    model="hf",
    model_args="pretrained=gpt2",
    tasks=["lambada_openai"]
)
print("Perplexity Results:", results)
```


The following are sample results obtained during a language model evaluation:

```plaintext
1. Perplexity: -5.602557182312012
   Accuracy (acc): 0
   Text: Prompt hash 'd545ed86b0b9402115d2df96bf9a8d21b172f3df9715c97d2005e04c9ab8b152'
   
2. Perplexity: -2.8345658779144287
   Accuracy (acc): 0
   Text: 
   "I imagine there are other ways to do it but I've never investigated any. Crystals work for me so I use them.
    “There are other ways we know of but crystals are in the top three for efficiency of storage.”
    “What other ways?”
    “We have constructed batteries that will store magic. Depending on what materials they are made of they can be better than crystals."

3. Perplexity: -6.1513566970825195
   Accuracy (acc): 0
   Text:
   "So what have you found out?" Gaent asked.
   Nero put out both hands in front of him, fingers wide. "Nothing," he pronounced.
   "You were always a good investigator," said Gaent. "I don’t believe it’s nothing."
   "Maybe I’ve lost my touch," said Nero.
```

#### What Do These Results Mean?

##### **1. Negative Perplexity Values**
   - **What it Indicates**:
     - Perplexity is typically a positive metric, calculated as the exponential of the average negative log probability of the tokens. However, frameworks like `lm-evaluation-harness` sometimes represent log probabilities directly (e.g., negative values here indicate high confidence).
     - The more negative the perplexity, the better the model's fluency and token prediction accuracy.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - A perplexity of `-6.1513566970825195` suggests the model is highly confident in its predictions compared to `-2.8345658779144287`.

##### **2. Accuracy (`acc`)**
   - **What it Indicates**:
     - `acc = 0` means the target word or token was not correctly predicted by the model.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - Despite low perplexity (high confidence), the model did not correctly predict the target token for the given context. This highlights a possible mismatch between token prediction confidence and correctness.

##### **3. Context Matters**
   - The text associated with each result provides insight into where the model performed poorly:
     - **Example 1**: Perplexity `-5.602` but `acc = 0` implies that while the model was confident, its prediction was incorrect in the given context.
     - **Example 2**: Perplexity `-2.834` suggests lower fluency/confidence, which is reflected in the accuracy score.

#### Practical Takeaways for Perplexity
1. **Lower (More Negative) Perplexity**:
   - Indicates higher confidence in token prediction.
   - Does not always guarantee correctness, as shown by `acc = 0`.

2. **When to Use Perplexity**:
   - Evaluate model fluency and language generation quality.
   - Use alongside metrics like `accuracy` or `BLEU` to gain a holistic view.

3. **Improving Results**:
   - Fine-tune the model with domain-specific data.
   - Adjust sampling strategies for better context alignment.

While perplexity is valuable for assessing fluency, it does not account for correctness or relevance. Complement perplexity with other metrics like accuracy, BLEU, or ROUGE for a comprehensive evaluation.
