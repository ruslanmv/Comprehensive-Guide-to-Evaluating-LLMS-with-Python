## Setting Up the Environment

### Prerequisites

Install all the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas sklearn rouge-score nltk detoxify lm-eval matplotlib
```

### Example Datasets

Define example datasets that will be used across multiple metric evaluations:

#### Dataset for Accuracy and Logical Consistency
```python
gold_standard = [
    {"query": "What is 2 + 2?", "correct_answer": "4"},
    {"query": "Who wrote Macbeth?", "correct_answer": "William Shakespeare"},
    {"query": "What is the boiling point of water?", "correct_answer": "100째C"}
]

model_outputs = [
    {"query": "What is 2 + 2?", "output": "4"},
    {"query": "Who wrote Macbeth?", "output": "Charles Dickens"},
    {"query": "What is the boiling point of water?", "output": "100째C"}
]
```

#### Dataset for Toxicity Detection
```python
texts = [
    "This is a friendly and respectful comment.",
    "This is a hateful and offensive comment."
]
```

## Metrics and Python Implementations

### 1. **Hallucination Reduction Rate (HRR)**

#### Formula
\[
HRR = \frac{\text{Number of hallucinations reduced}}{\text{Total hallucinations in baseline}} \times 100
\]

#### Python Implementation
```python
def calculate_hrr(baseline_outputs, validated_outputs):
    hallucinations_reduced = sum(
        1 for base, valid in zip(baseline_outputs, validated_outputs)
        if base["is_hallucination"] and not valid["is_hallucination"]
    )
    total_hallucinations = sum(1 for base in baseline_outputs if base["is_hallucination"])
    hrr = (hallucinations_reduced / total_hallucinations) * 100 if total_hallucinations > 0 else 0
    return hrr

# Example usage
baseline_outputs = [
    {"query": "What is the boiling point of water?", "output": "50째C", "is_hallucination": True},
    {"query": "Who wrote Hamlet?", "output": "Charles Dickens", "is_hallucination": True}
]
validated_outputs = [
    {"query": "What is the boiling point of water?", "output": "100째C", "is_hallucination": False},
    {"query": "Who wrote Hamlet?", "output": "William Shakespeare", "is_hallucination": False}
]

hrr_score = calculate_hrr(baseline_outputs, validated_outputs)
print(f"Hallucination Reduction Rate (HRR): {hrr_score:.2f}%")
```

### 2. **Logical Consistency Score (LCS)**

#### Formula
\[
LCS = \frac{\text{Number of logically consistent responses}}{\text{Total responses}} \times 100
\]

#### Python Implementation
```python
def calculate_lcs(responses):
    consistent_responses = sum(1 for response in responses if response["is_consistent"])
    return (consistent_responses / len(responses)) * 100

# Example usage
responses = [
    {"query": "If A > B and B > C, is A > C?", "output": "Yes", "is_consistent": True},
    {"query": "Is it possible for a square to have three sides?", "output": "No", "is_consistent": True}
]
lcs_score = calculate_lcs(responses)
print(f"Logical Consistency Score (LCS): {lcs_score:.2f}%")
```

### 3. **Response Accuracy (RA)**

#### Formula
\[
RA = \frac{\text{Number of correct responses}}{\text{Total queries}} \times 100
\]

#### Python Implementation
```python
def calculate_ra(gold_standard, model_outputs):
    correct_responses = sum(
        1 for gold, output in zip(gold_standard, model_outputs)
        if gold["correct_answer"] == output["output"]
    )
    return (correct_responses / len(gold_standard)) * 100

```python
def exact_match(prediction, target):
    return prediction == target

# Example usage
em_score = exact_match("Paris", "Paris")
print(f"Exact Match (EM): {em_score}")
```

### 5. **F1 Score**

#### Formula
\[
F1 = \frac{2 \times (\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall})}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\]

#### Python Implementation
```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

def calculate_f1(predictions, targets):
    return f1_score(targets, predictions)

# Example usage
predictions = [1, 0, 1, 1]
targets = [1, 0, 0, 1]
print(f"F1 Score: {calculate_f1(predictions, targets):.2f}")
```

### 6. **ROUGE**

#### Python Implementation
```python
from rouge_score import rouge_scorer

def calculate_rouge(prediction, target):
    scorer = rouge_scorer.RougeScorer(['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_stemmer=True)
    return scorer.score(target, prediction)

# Example usage
rouge_scores = calculate_rouge("The cat sat on the mat.", "The cat is on the mat.")
print(rouge_scores)
```

### 7. **BLEU**

#### Python Implementation
```python
from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu

def calculate_bleu(prediction, target):
    reference = [target.split()]
    candidate = prediction.split()
    return sentence_bleu(reference, candidate)

# Example usage
bleu_score = calculate_bleu("The cat is on the mat.", "The cat sat on the mat.")
print(f"BLEU Score: {bleu_score:.2f}")
```

### 8. **Toxicity Detection**

#### Python Implementation
```python
from detoxify import Detoxify

def detect_toxicity(text):
    model = Detoxify('original')
    return model.predict(text)

# Example usage
for text in texts:
    print(f"Toxicity for '{text}': {detect_toxicity(text)}")
```

### 9. **Using `lm-evaluation-harness`**

#### Installation
```bash
pip install lm-eval
```

#### Basic Usage
```python
from lm_eval import Evaluator

evaluator = Evaluator(model="gpt2", tasks=["lambada", "piqa"])
results = evaluator.evaluate()
print(results)
```
